code for real data analysis I: No2 data
Notes for data set: 8 column
C1: response, hourly values of the logarithm of the concentration of NO2(particles)
C2: logarithm of the number of cars per hour
C3:  temperature 2 meters above ground
C4:  wind spped
C5:  temperature differencebetween 25 and 2 meters above ground
C6:  wind direction
C7:  U, hours of day
C8:   day number
% aim 
resort this data set into a time series and 
select covariates: wind speed, log car numbers, and difference of temperature
covariates are transformed on [0,1]
