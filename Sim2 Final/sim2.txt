Code for Example 2 
There are 3 data sets: 
Dat1,  Dat2 and Dat3 are data for Table and power function figures
Table 2 in the body : power of the test under different  sample sizes and alternatives

Script:
1、sim2.m: main procedure for simulation of seperable testing
2、writeDat.m: generate the data sets (three sets)

function:
3、autoreg1.m:   generate locally stationally process
4、mydata2.m:   data generating process
5、rspline.m:      generate B-spline matrix
6、Spest.m:        Three-step Spline estimation for component functions of varying-coefficient 
                          and  additive function
7、myknot.m:     select optimal knots in varying-coefficient additive function under specified order of
                          B-spline and gruops
8、myknot_vca.m: select  optimal knots  among choice for groups and order of B-spline in initial estimation
9、plotDiff.m:        plot the regression curves under null and alternative hypothesis testing for simple case
     (as an exercise
10、BivEst.m:        spine estimations of bivariate functions
11、Bivknot.m:     optimal knots for bivariate spline estimations
12、mytest.m:      construct test statistic
13、mypower.m:  compute the power 
14、plotdensity.m: plot power function and density of test statistics based on Monte Carlo replications
       and bootstrap approximations

Print: MatPower  gives the comparisons of power
